    Intramuscular:  The dosage is generally one 75 mg ampoule daily, given by deep intragluteal injection into the upper outer quadrant. In the severe cases the daily dose can exceptionally be increased to two injections of 75mg, separated by an interval of a few hours.
    </br>Alternatively, one ampoule of 75 mg can be combined with other dosage forms of orafen (tablet) up to a maximum dosage of 150 mg. Orafen®- plus should not be given for more than 2days; if necessary, treatment can be continued with orafen tablets</br>
    <strong>Use in pregnancy & Lactation :</strong> Because of the known effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs on the fetal cardiovascular system (closure of ductus arteriosus), use during pregnancy (particularly late pregnancy) should be avoided. Labor and Delivery In rat studies with NSAIDs, as with other drugs known to inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, an increased incidence of dystocia, delayed parturition, and decreased pup survival occurred. The effects of Diclofenac on labor and delivery in pregnant women are unknown. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from Diclofenac, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.  Geriatric Use As with any NSAIDs, caution should be exercised in treating the elderly (65 years and older) </br>
